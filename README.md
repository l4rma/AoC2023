This is my first ever attempt at completing advent of code. I have next to no
experience coding in rust. So im doing this mostly to check out Rust.

## Progress
| Day | Part1 | Part2 | Comments                                                                                                             |
|----:|:-----:|:-----:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  01 |  ⭐   |  ⭐   | This took SO much more time than expected..                                                                          |
|  02 |  ⭐   |  ⭐   | Part 2 much easier than part 1.                                                                                      |
|  03 |  ⭐   |  ⭐   | Part 2 much harder than part 2 😅                                                                                    |
|  04 |  ⭐   |  ⭐   | Brute forced part 2. Completed it without realizing b/c it took forever to run the code. (time cmd returned 409.05s) |
|  05 |       |       |                                                                                                                      |
